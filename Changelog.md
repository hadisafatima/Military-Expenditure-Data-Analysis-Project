# Version Control

### June 26, 2025
- Started the Analysis Project with Data Cleaning.
- Calculated the Missing Values % for each row.
- Dopped the rows with Missing Value % greater than 20 and 2 more rows.
- Started the Documentation of the Project.


### June 27, 2025
- Handled the remaining Missing value cells.
- Dropped the unnecessary custom and predifned columns.
- No Duplicates Found.


### June 28, 2025
- Performed EDA.
- Drafted Objectives/Questions to achieve/answer.
  
### June 29, 2025
- Filled out remaning values of EDA.

### June 30, 2025
- Decided to re-perform EDA Process, because the EDA results were skewing, I figured this and understood that EDA needs to be preformed on the copy of Original Dataset so we can understand the patterns, Outliers and potential anomalies in the dataset.
- Starting EDA Process again, this time on the copy of the Original Dataset.
- Calculated Min, Max, Median, Average and Sum for each Country and Year.

### July 01, 2025
- Filled out all the remaining values of EDAs.

### July 02, 2025
- Created Necessary Visuals based on calculated EDAs.

### July 03, 2025 - July 06, 2025
- Break, because of the month of Muharram

### July 07, 2025 - July 08, 2025
- Figured that for Visualizations in Tabulae I can't have years as different columns.
- Decided to transpose the dataset so I can have all years in a single Column.

### July 08, 2025
- Tried to figure out formula for converting dataset from wide to long format.
- Couldn't find out any formual or easier techniques so created a long format a dataset by using data ranges and copy and pasting from cleaned and complete dataset.

### July 09, 2025 - July 10, 2025
- Took a Break

### July 11, 2025
- Completed the conversion of Wide Format Dataset to Long Format.

### July 12, 2025
- Answered remaining questions.
- Created the Visualizations in Tabulae.
